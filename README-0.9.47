Release Notes for EmberMUD v0.9.47
----------------------------------
Lots of bugfixes in this release and a few new things.  Dorzak and I
have both become very busy as of late (thereby explaining the
slowness of releases and recent lack of work on the project).

We have a lot of ideas in mind for the next release, but I refuse
to promise anything at this time other than there WILL be another
release eventually (I swear to release a v1.0 before quitting
the project)!

Visit the official EmberMUD homepage for all the latest info...
We have a nice news posting setup now to make the page easy to
update - hopefully that means we'll do it more often. <grin>

always available here):
