Solved the Maze.~
You have solved the maze.  You can tell by the last few moves
that there is no way that a dumb worker could have figured that
out.  It seems pretty desolate here.  To the south is a bleak room.
To the north, you see the maze.  There is a sign above the south exit:

    Those who enter, plan on a timely death.
    Especially if you're loyal to the queen.

earth.  Here lies the palace of the dwarven queen, and untold riches.
But beware, for the mines are said to be haunted by demon and spirit alike.
