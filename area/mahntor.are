The dark woods~
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.

You stand at the edge of a dark forest. A path leads north into the forest and
its deadly darkness and silence. Looking west, you see a path that leads up
into a foothills region. Standing here on the boundary between light and

This is a small intersection. Paths lead east, west, and south. You are struck
by the carnage here when you enter the clearing. There appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were dragged off in two 
directions, south and east.

You are climbing on a rocky hillside. As you scramble about, loose rocks and
small boulders bounce and fall down below you. Looking to the east and west,
you see more stable ground. The hillside itself goes on higher to the south

You are in foothills that are sparsely covered by scraggly bushes and weather

can be seen. Looking east, you see a small pass that will allow you to leave

deeper into the foothills or to the west where a small pass will allow you to
climb down.

Before the huge tree~
You enter a large ring of boulders. Sheltered by this wall of stones, a small
cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

Before the dark cave~
You stand directly before a huge dark cave. The rocks and boulders outside the
cave are covered with blood stains and all types of broken and shattered bones
lie around. An unbearable stench comes from within the cave itself. The dark
cave entrance looms to the east. The hills themselves lead towards the
north, south, and west.

Inside the horrid cave~
The stench is overwhelming. You can hardly breathe as you enter the cave.
Looking around, you realize that some bizarre and horrible creature uses this
cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.

The hills overlooking the shore~
Standing at the edge of the foothills, you are able to look down upon a rocky
shoreline. It appears as though a vast ocean is to the south. Sea birds have
made their nests here in the rocks and you are heartened by the presence of
life here. It is possible to climb down to the shore here. The hills
themselves are to the north. The edge of the hills leads to the east along the
shoreline.

The hills overlooking the shoreline~
You stand on a barren section of hills that overlook a rocky shoreline. The
stiff ocean wind has blown the rocks smooth here and you have to lean forward
a bit to keep your balance. The salty sea air fills your nostrils and you
notice signs of life in the rocky crags here. You can climb down towards the
shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are
standing leads east and west along the shoreline.

You stand on a rocky summit overlooking a rough shoreline below. The sea wind
blows hard across the rocks here and they have been worn smooth with time.
Looking around, you notice that you can safely climb down towards the shore.
The hills themselves stretch towards the north. The rough summit you stand
upon leads west along the shoreline.

across the dark street. Small streets lead west and south here.

The Square of Mahn-Tor~
This appears to be the main square of Mahn-Tor. A huge fountain graces the
center of the square, but the extreme cold has turned it into an ice
sculpture. The water has frozen in arcs through the air. Snow and ice covers
the square and small streets lead east and west. To the north, you see
the gates to the city. You also notice a small store to the south.
A small sign hangs outside the store.
