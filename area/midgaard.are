    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

The Temple Of Mota~
You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Mota.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing gods, giants and peasants.
   Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
   Equally large steps lead UP through a small door into the ENTRANCE to MUD 
SCHOOL.  (type 'up' to go to MUD SCHOOL.)  A small plaque is on this wall.

Kate's Diner~
The smells of baking bread and simmering stew lead you dancing through
the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the
booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out to talk.

Melancholy's Maps~
As you walk in, a sudden gust of wind enters the shop and sends several
scraps of paper fly around the room.  You blink as the dust you've stirred 
up stings your eyes, and take a look around the shop.  This shop is cluttered 
with old pieces of parchment, stacks of books, and odd scraps.  A desk with 
slightly less clutter than the rest of the shop is in front of you.  A scroll 
case full of scrolls is behind the desk.  A bookcase is to the left of you, 
and to the left is a window overlooking the Common Square.  A small door,

Grebe's Tavern~
Dive.  That's all you can say about this place; its a
dive.  You step carefully over the dead and/or drunk sailors
on the floor toward the center of the room.  There's no
decorations on the wall; they've all been ripped down in anger
or for use as weapons at one time or another.  Looking around,
you search vainly for a clean table to sit at, and then give up.

The Trading Post~
Bolts of cloth are stacked in monstrous heaps around the room.  Barrells 
of spices fill the corners.  Crates and boxes are stacked in a haphazard
manner about the room.  Merchants wander in and out of a back door, moving
strange boxes filled with mysterious goods and bound for exotic locations.
A schedule for the various caravans is posted on the walls.  This is the
local trading post.  It hums and buzzes with excitement.

A Florists Shop~
The fragrant scent of flowers in full bloom embraces you as you enter
the shop.  Pots and bowls with roses, petunias, daisies, tulips, and 
carnations line the shelves along the walls.  Smaller pots of herbs and
spices rest on tables near the front of the room.  A counter stands in
the back of the room.  A woman is there, trimming some sort of small,
green plant.

Andy's Pub~
The busy pub is filled with patrons.  People are laughing and singing.
A minstrel plays his lute in another part of the pub, and a few people 
are even dancing.  Andy, the pubs owner, wanders around and checks to see
that the needs of his customers are met.  The bar is to your south.  East
of you is another section of the pub.  You know that there are rooms to
be had somewhere around here...

A Room in the Pub~
This part of the pub is filled with dancing and singing.  A wandering
minstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed
woman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk
men sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the
crowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub
is located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy
in a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this 
prosperous establishment.

The Bar~
A long mahogany bar is set in the back of the pub.  Mugs line a shelf
behind the bar.  Bottles of strong, nasty looking liquids decorate one
of the lower shelves.  A large cask rests on a table behind the bar.  A
strong but friendly-looking bartender stands next to the cask polishing
glasses.  A couple of the bar maids stand in a corner and throw the most 
inviting glances your way.

The Inn~
You are standing upstairs from Andy's Pub at Andy's Inn.  A few chairs
and a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large
stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with 
wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is 
probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.
