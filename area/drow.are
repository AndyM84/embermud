You are standing in front of a highly and freshly bloodstained altar.
Engraved on the top of the altar is a giant spider with a human head. Looking
down from the altar you see a large sacrificial pit.

Slave Pen~
Rotten meat and breads lie about the floor while shackles hang from the
walls. The room wreaks of death. You almost become nauseous and decide to leave
the room since you were obviously too late to save the slave.

Dais~
You stand upon a dais behind the altar. Above you is a enormous illusion
of a female drow turning into a giant spider and back again. There is a door
to the west.

This is obviously only a temporary storage place for the collected

Weaponsmaster's Chamber~
This one person bedchamber is very elegant. The owner must be held in high
to get this kind of treatment.
